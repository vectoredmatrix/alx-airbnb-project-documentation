Objective: Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

Instructions:

Based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.

The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.

Export your diagram as a PNG file as data-flow.png and store it in a directory called data-flow-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.
